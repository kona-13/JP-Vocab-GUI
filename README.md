A Tkinter application that generates a single random Japanese words from a list. I intend to make it so that it pulls from a document instead of the current method - but we will see if I actually do it lol.

The words were sourced from this list: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13PjfuQSsbkixNGj_9U271M6eqGVVWp5ATRivKlN06S4/edit#gid=0

So far it is just the "JLPT4" words (Older format pre N5-N1 levels) - with plans to add more to and improve it (a lot lol).

Feel free to do whatever you want with this.

I used this font - so you will probably need it: https://fonts.google.com/noto/specimen/Noto+Sans+JP

I mostly have only tested this using the Spyder IDE - It works on my install of python on windows as well.
I have encountered issues with Anaconda relating to the CSV line - ignoring any issues until I finish it.
