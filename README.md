2 Tkinter applications that pull vocabulary from vocab.csv.

1.) main.py - randomly pulls words from vocab.csv

2.) ordered.py - pulls from vocab.csv in order. Added Reset button to this one for ease of use.

These applications are intended to be used to learn and review vocab.

The words were sourced from this list: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13PjfuQSsbkixNGj_9U271M6eqGVVWp5ATRivKlN06S4/edit#gid=0

Feel free to do whatever you want with this. The .csv format is: Kanji, Kana, Meaning, Type (i.e. Noun), JLPT Level*. Laying out another dataset like this and naming it vocab.csv will work fine. E.g. https://imgur.com/a/Q3nAGUk

*This dataset uses the old JLPT levels - so it predates the N5 - N1, instead using JLPT4 - JLPT1, with an additional set of words under JLPT0 - see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese-Language_Proficiency_Test#Older_edition

I used this font - so you will probably need it: https://fonts.google.com/noto/specimen/Noto+Sans+JP

A guide on how to add the font: https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/add-a-font-b7c5f17c-4426-4b53-967f-455339c564c1

Plan to add:

1.) Merge 2 programs into one

2.) A sorting algorithm of sorts so that you see words you have just seen and found hard again sooner

3.) Radio buttons to exclude vocab by level.
