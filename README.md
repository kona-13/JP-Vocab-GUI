A Tkinter application that pulls a random word from a .csv file.

The words were sourced from this list: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13PjfuQSsbkixNGj_9U271M6eqGVVWp5ATRivKlN06S4/edit#gid=0

Feel free to do whatever you want with this.

I used this font - so you will probably need it: https://fonts.google.com/noto/specimen/Noto+Sans+JP

A guide on how to add the font: https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/add-a-font-b7c5f17c-4426-4b53-967f-455339c564c1

Plan to add:

1.) A sorting algorithm of sorts so that you see words you have just seen and found hard again sooner

2.) Radio buttons to exclude vocab by level.
